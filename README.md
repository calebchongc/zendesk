# zendesk
Notebook I used for working with support tickets using the Zendesk API.
The notebook is used to generate semi-random tickets within specific time ranges using the Zendesk Bulk Import ticket API. 
Tickets with attachments are also supported.
The large volume of tickets can be used to test export workflows, and speed is dependent on your Zendesk instance's rate limit.
This has been tested up to the current maximum rate limit that Zendesk supports on their API (2500rpm)
